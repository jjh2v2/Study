Asteroids D3D12
===============

The Intel asteroids sample was developed as an example of how to use the DirectX 12 graphics API to get performance and power benefits over previous APIs. For more information on the sample, please see: https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/08/11/siggraph-2014-directx-12-on-intel
